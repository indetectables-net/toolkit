***Developer:*** Hors <br/>
***Description:*** XVolkolak is an unpacker emulator. Unlike programs of this type, it does not use DebugAPI and other features of the operating system. Everything is emulated. You can safely unpack malware for further investigation without the risk of damaging the system.
All machine instructions are not executed on a real processor, so unpacking occurs regardless of the processor type and the operating system. <br/>
